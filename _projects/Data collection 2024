Here are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XsdKcBwXkCSRrZFae1rhb3tdT2GRzFTh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102358639314492490823&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Instructions on data collection in 2024 (PDF)</a>. Note this draft is only used for comment, and we will upload a final version for data collection. 

We plan to store the data and photos collected from the field using Google Drive. There are 11 folders, each for a site. 
In each folder, you will find the datasheets needed for **Regular survey** and **Peak growing season measurement** and places to upload photos. 
Currently, only the Bordeaux folder is available, and it's publicly accessible. After this period, only persons with given access can access these folders.
