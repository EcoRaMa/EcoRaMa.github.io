**Sowing:** You need to put the seeds you receive in a fridge at ca. 4 degrees Celsius, as we do in Lausanne before you sow them. Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11mZJjnlfJHpSKzIaNaXyvFToOeMgyQP7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sowing protocol - March 2024 (PDF)</a>.

**Data loggers:** In each site, we install two TMS-4 data loggers to record the air temperature, temperature at the ground level, soil temperature and moisture. To do this, we need to first assembly the caps onto the top of TMS-4 loggers, as shown on the <a href="https://tomst.com/web/en/systems/tms/tms-4/">TMS-4 website</a>. We then insert them into the soil at ca. 15 cm depth such that the middle temperature sensors record temperature at the ground level. The data loggers you received have started recording every 15 minutes. The battery and storage should allow them to work continuously for 10 years. So you can safely leave them in the field throughout the experiment and send them to Lausanne at the end of the experiment to download the data. If climate data is needed at some point, you could also download it with a data reader (if you don't have one, we will need to send it to you from Lausanne, but your institute or colleagues may have it as well) and the <a href="https://tomst.com/web/en/systems/tms/software/">Lolly software</a>.
