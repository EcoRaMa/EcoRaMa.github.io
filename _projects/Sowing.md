**Seeds** The seeds you received have been divided into small bags. You need to put them in a fridge at ca. 4 degrees Celsius, as we do in Lausanne, before you sow them. We follow this document <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11mZJjnlfJHpSKzIaNaXyvFToOeMgyQP7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sowing protocol - March 2024 (PDF)</a> to sow them. 

**Data loggers** Each site also receives two TMS-4 data loggers to record the temperature of air, ground level and soil and soil moisture. We need to install their caps as shown on the <a href="https://tomst.com/web/en/systems/tms/tms-4/">TMS-4 website</a> and insert them into soil at ca. 15 cm depth such that the middle temperaute sensors record soil surface temperature. The data loggers you received have started recording temperature and moisture every 15 mins. The battery and storage should allow them to work continuously for 10 years. So you can safely leave them in the field throughout the experiment and send them to Lausanne at the end of the experiment to download the data. If climate data is needed at some point, you could also download the data if a data reader is available.
