#### Overview 2025

In 2025, we monitor the plots on a regular basis (**Regular survey 2025**; ca. two hours each time). The regular survey happens once a month and more frequent surveys (e.g. once every two weeks) is recommended when germination (e.g. in spring and autumn) and mortality (e.g. in winter) is active. At the end of the growing season in late spring or early summer, we measure and sample some individuals and disturb the plots (**Harvest & Disturbance 2025**; ca. one week). We expect the flowering and growing seasons in 2025 to be advanced (e.g. by one or two months) compared to 2024 because seeds are already in the plots since summer 2024 and they could germinate earlier (e.g. in late autumn 2024 or early spring 2025). At the end of autumn when temperature is too cold for seeds to germinate, we bury seeds in mesh bags in each plot to estimate seed survival over winter (**Seed survival 2025**; ca. 4 hours). To reduce the workload in 2025, we plan to measure only plant height and harvest some female plants for seeds but not to sample leaves for DNA or measure other morphological traits. The expected workload corresponds to an estimated 14 working days. These data will allow us to compare the germination behavior and demographic performance between the first and second generations and among experimental populations subject to different admixture treatments and climates. 

We expect the flowering and growing seasons in 2025 to be advanced (e.g. by one or two months) compared to the previous year because seeds are already in the plots since summer 2024 and they could germinate earlier (e.g. in late autumn 2024 or early spring 2025). We will need to decide on the exact dates individually for each garden based on the regular survey. Our current guesses for the likely best harvest time for the plots are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Tel Aviv: mid March</li>  
  <li>Bordeaux: mid May</li>
  <li>Lausanne: mid June</li>
  <li>Prague: mid-June till early July</li>
  <li>Kassel, Waageningen and Oxford: end of July or early August</li>
  <li>Edinburgh, Bergen, Uppsala, Helsinki: early to mid-September</li>
</ul>

#### Protocols

Note that we may need to make small changes to the beta version of the documents based on the feedback from our partners in the southern gardens. 
So, it would be a good idea to download the document right before your measurement.

####  Datasheet and data entry

The field-collected data is stored on Google Drive. There are 11 folders, each for a site. 
In each folder, you can find the Excel template for the Regular survey, flowering size and intensive measurement. 
You can print and use them in the field and enter the data you collect afterwards. 
In each folder, there are also subfolders where you can upload photos and datasheet scans. 
You or your helpers need to ask for first-time access to the folders.
