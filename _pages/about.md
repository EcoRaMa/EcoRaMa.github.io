### Ecology and Evolution of Species Range Margins

EcoRaMa aims to understand the ecological and evolutionary factors regulating species range margins. It uses a dioecious annual plant, *Mercurialis annua* (2n), as a model species. Specifically, it has three main aims: (1) to examine the impacts of gene flow on demography and population dynamics, (2) to examine the impacts of gene flow on local adaptation (3), and to uncover the genetic and genomic basis of local adaptation. To answer these questions, we will establish experiments with four treatments simulating four scenarios of gene flow, respectively: admixture-free, within-region admixture, between-region admixture and refugium admixture; each treatment has three replicates, giving rise to 12 plots at each site, in total. Overall, we will use 21 diploid populations of an annual plant M. annua sampled from seven sites across its range (though each site will use a subset of these populations), allowing us to examine to what extent the impacts of gene flow on demography and local adaptation vary with the genetic and climatic distances between source populations. The experiment will be established in 13 sites across its range and ran for five years, allowing to examine to what extend the impacts of gene flow on demography and local adaptation vary with the environment where plants are grown.
