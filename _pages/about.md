<h1> Ecology and Evolution of Species Range Margins </h1> 

### Range margins as an ecology and evolution problem
The processes shaping species range margins have interested ecologists and evolutionary biologists for a long time and received increasing attention as ongoing environmental changes are reshaping species ranges. Over the ecological time scale, range margins occur when species can maintain persistent populations within ranges but fail to do so due to environmental constraints beyond range margins (Fig. 1A). Over the evolutionary time scales, range margins occur when species can overcome environmental constraints by local adaptation within their ranges but fail to do so beyond range margins (Fig. 1B). Two main population-genetic hypotheses have been advanced to explain the failure of local adaptation. First, local adaptation in marginal populations may be hindered by ongoing gene flow from the core of the species distribution, such that maladaptive immigrant alleles ‘swamp’ any responses to local selection (the ‘swamping’ hypothesis). Alternatively, marginal populations may be typically small and relatively inbred, with low genetic diversity due to repeated bottlenecks, with the consequent greater expression of deleterious recessive mutations and thus poor demographic performance; in this case, migration from other populations should ‘rescue’ marginal populations from the ill-effects of genetic drift and inbreeding (the ‘rescue’ hypothesis).

### Study system
In this project, we use a wind-pollinated dioecious (and thus fully outcrossing) annual plant, Mercurialis annua, as a model system. M. annua has a range across Europe and the Middle East (the shaded area in Fig. 2), resulting from northern- and westward range expansion out of an eastern Mediterranean refugium after the Pleistocene glaciation ended. It has recently proved ideal for experimental evolution under semi-natural conditions. We have sampled seeds from its range edge (orange) and core (green), and refugium (blue) (Fig. 2).

### Experimental design
In spring 2024, we will establish populations at 11 localities across and beyond its range (see Fig. 3 for typical design at an edge site). These populations are subject to different 'admixture' (i.e. migration) treatments, ranging from zero (no admixture) to local (local admixture) to distant (core-edge admixture and refugium-edge admixture).

### Aims
We will monitor the evolution of these experimental populations for four generations in terms of phenotypic variation, demographic performance, and genome sequence variation to uncover the ecological and evolutionary processes that contribute to range margins, focusing on distinguishing between the swamping and rescue explanations for species range margins. We aims: 
(1)	Data-driven demographic modelling: identify environmental factos, including abiotic and biotic factors, that limit population growth towards range margins;
(2)	Quantitive genetics: Quanitfy selection for phenotype and idenity factors, such as trait heritability and associations, and pleiotropy, that limit local adaptation beyond range margins;
(3)	Population genetics: Characterise genetic changes over consective generations to to unrave genetic basis of local adpatation.
