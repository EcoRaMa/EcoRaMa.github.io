### Ecology and Evolution of Species Range Margins
The processes shaping species range margins have interested ecologists and evolutionary biologists for a long time and have received increasing attention as ongoing environmental changes are shifting species' ranges. Over the ecological time scale, range margins occur when species can maintain persistent populations within ranges but fail to do so due to environmental constraints beyond range margins (Panel A in the figure below). Over the evolutionary time scale, range margins occur when species can overcome environmental constraints by local adaptation within their ranges but fail to do so beyond range margins (Panel B).

Two main population-genetic hypotheses have been advanced to explain the failure of local adaptation. First, local adaptation in marginal populations may be hindered by ongoing gene flow from the core of the species distribution, such that maladaptive immigrant alleles ‘swamp’ any responses to local selection (the ‘swamping’ hypothesis). Alternatively, marginal populations may be typically small and relatively inbred, with low genetic diversity due to repeated bottlenecks, with the consequent greater expression of deleterious recessive mutations and thus poor demographic performance; in this case, migration from other populations should ‘rescue’ marginal populations from the ill-effects of genetic drift and inbreeding (the ‘rescue’ hypothesis).

## Study system
In this project, we use a wind-pollinated dioecious (and thus fully outcrossing) annual plant, Mercurialis annua, as a model system. M. annua has a range across Europe and the Middle East (the shaded area), resulting from northern- and westward range expansion out of an eastern Mediterranean refugium after the Pleistocene glaciation ended. It has recently proved ideal for experimental evolution under semi-natural conditions. We have sampled seeds from 21 populations at seven localities: range edge (orange, n = 3 localities), core (green, n = 3 localities), and refugium (blue, n = 3 localities).

## Experimental design
In spring 2024, we will establish populations at 11 localities across and beyond its range. At each locality, the experimental populations are subject to different 'admixture' (i.e. migration) treatments, ranging from zero (no admixture) to local (local admixture) to distant (core-edge admixture and refugium-edge admixture). The figure below shows a typical design at an edge site. Across study regions, these populations are exposed to range-wide variation in abiotic and biotic conditions.

## Aims
We will monitor the evolution of these experimental populations for four generations regarding phenotypic variation, demographic performance, and genome sequence variation. Combining the data with demographic modelling, quantitive genetics, and population genetics, we aim to uncover the ecological and evolutionary processes that contribute to range margins, specifically,

<ul>
  <li>(1) To identify environmental factors, including abiotic and biotic factors, that limit population growth towards range margins</li> 
  <li>(2) To distinguish between the swamping and rescue explanations for species' range margins</li> 
  <li>(3) To uncover the phenotypic and genetic factors limiting local adaptation beyond range margins.</li> 
  <li>(4) To unravel the genetic basis of local adaptation</li> 
</ul>
