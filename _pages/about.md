EcoRaMa aims to understand the ecological and evolutionary factors regulating species range margins. Specifically, it has three main aims: (1) to examine the impacts of gene flow on demography and population dynamics, (2) to examine the impacts of gene flow on local adaptation (3), and to uncover the genetic and genomic basis of local adaptation. To answer these questions, we will establish experiments with four treatments simulating four scenarios of gene flow, respectively: admixture-free, within-region admixture, between-region admixture and refugium admixture; each treatment has three replicates, giving rise to 12 plots at each site, in total. Overall, we will use 21 diploid populations of an annual plant M. annua sampled from seven sites across its range (though each site will use a subset of these populations), allowing us to examine to what extent the impacts of gene flow on demography and local adaptation vary with the genetic and climatic distances between source populations. The experiment will be established in 13 sites across its range and ran for five years, allowing to examine to what extend the impacts of gene flow on demography and local adaptation vary with the environment where plants are grown.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
